# ðŸªŸConditional Statements

## Introduction

This guide aims to explain basic conditional statements for beginners in Python programming. Conditional statements allow your program to take different paths based on certain conditions.

### Basic Conditional Statements

#### If Statement

The `if` statement allows specific blocks of code to be executed when a certain condition is true.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

#### If-Else Statement

The `if-else` statement executes a block of code if a condition is true; otherwise, it executes another block of code.

```python
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

#### If-Elif-Else Statement

The `if-elif-else` statement is used when a series of conditions need to be checked sequentially, and the corresponding code block is executed.

```python
x = 7

if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

### Examples

#### Temperature Condition Check

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("The weather is hot")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("The weather is mild")
else:
    print("The weather is cool")
```

#### User Authentication

```python
username = "admin"
password = "12345"

input_username = input("Enter username: ")
input_password = input("Enter password: ")

if input_username == username and input_password == password:
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Incorrect username or password")
```

These examples demonstrate how to use basic conditional statements. For more complex scenarios, you can refer to the Python documentation.

This guide can serve as the beginning of a section explaining basic conditional statements in your GitBook. You can create your own GitBook by adding more examples and explanations to expand the content.

### Nested Conditional Statements

#### Example 1: Weather Condition Check

```python
temperature = 28
humidity = 60

if temperature > 30:
    if humidity > 70:
        print("It is hot and humid; it might be good to cool off.")
    else:
        print("It is hot, but the humidity is low; it's a pleasant day!")
else:
    print("The weather is mild.")
```

In this example, the outer `if` condition checks the temperature, while the inner `if` condition checks the humidity. If the temperature is above 30 degrees and the humidity is above 70, it suggests cooling off. Otherwise, even though the temperature is high, it may be a pleasant day if the humidity is low.

#### Example 2: Student Grade Calculation

```python
grade = 75

if grade >= 90:
    print("Your grade is A")
elif grade >= 80:
    if grade >= 85:
        print("Your grade is B+")
    else:
        print("Your grade is B")
elif grade >= 70:
    if grade >= 75:
        print("Your grade is C+")
    else:
        print("Your grade is C")
else:
    print("Your grade is F")
```

In this example, different letter grades are calculated based on the student's numeric grade. Nested `if` and `elif` statements are used to determine the corresponding letter grades within specific ranges.

#### Example 3: User Authentication and Role Check

```python
username = "admin"
password = "12345"
role = "admin"

input_username = input("Enter username: ")
input_password = input("Enter password: ")

if input_username == username and input_password == password:
    print("Login successful.")
    if role == "admin":
        print("Welcome to the admin panel.")
    else:
        print("Welcome to the standard user panel.")
else:
    print("Incorrect username or password.")
```

In this example, if the username and password are correct and the user's role is "admin", the user gains access to the admin panel. Otherwise, they enter the standard user panel.

These examples demonstrate how nested conditional statements can be used simply and understandably. You can expand these basic structures for more complex scenarios.
